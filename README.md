## About Songbind :

Songbind is a project in early development that wants to provide the user different features to centralize, share and explore music with different existing music platforms. The app currently uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

The app is available on https://songbind.vercel.app/ but only for desktop screens.
